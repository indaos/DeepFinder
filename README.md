# DeepFinder

This app searches files using an existing macOS file system index, allowing instant queries without pre-indexing. It supports natural language or keyword-based searches, with AI converting queries into index words for immediate results. Unlike Finder, it sorts files by the highest number of index word matches, ranking results by probability based on your request.

The app works with or without AI, supporting OpenAI and Olama. Additionally, it can automatically classify files and add tags to speed up future searches.
